# syslib

A system abstraction (and orchestration) framework, for Python.

-------------------

The basic idea is that I want to be able to easily script the installation of Python web applications (and therefore, any application).

## Features

- Process Table Interaction
- Services Interaction (properly)
- Parse common system files.
- Instsall a service into nginx, following the conventions.

## Ideas

- Use supervisord to run long-running tasks?
